After logging into KintoHub, all users begin at the Environment Overview page.
This page provides a holistic view of your services in a single environment.
You can imagine combining your web, backend APIs, jobs, databases, and all the other services that make up your app within a single environment.

## Environment Overview Page

To get to the environment overview, you need to login to KintoHub and you will automatically be placed on the last Environment page you visited.
If you have not created an environment yet, you will be prompted to create one.

## Regions

Every KintoHub environment is hosted in a single cloud region. 
Regions are specific to the cloud host provider and its regions.
No matter the region you choose, you will be charged the same price as specified in [Billing](anatomy-billing.md)
